# Image Processing with Multi-threading

This project demonstrates an **image processing pipeline** using **multi-threading** to enhance performance. It includes features like **color boosting**, **detail enhancement**, and **image resizing**, with support for both single-threaded and multi-threaded execution. The project also integrates a **thread farm** to manage tasks efficiently.

---

## Features
- **Color Boosting**: Enhances pixel colors based on saturation levels.
- **Detail Enhancement**: Applies detail enhancement and median blur to specific regions of interest (ROIs).
- **Image Resizing**: Resizes images to 4K resolution (3840x2160).
- **Multi-threading**: Utilizes multiple threads to process different parts of the image simultaneously.
- **Thread Farm**: Manages tasks dynamically for efficient multi-threaded execution.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **OpenCV** (for image processing)
- **C++17** or later
- A C++ compiler (e.g., **GCC**, **MSVC**)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
